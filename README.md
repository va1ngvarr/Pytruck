# Pytruck
A simple game written in Python as an example of Pygame project

The project is needed to show structure of game in pygame. It implements WASD-control of the car. And of course weirdly moving bots, because they built on if-constructions!

The number of bots is defined in "BOT_AMOUNT" variable of the settings.py file, look for the rest of the values in settings.py and Car folder
