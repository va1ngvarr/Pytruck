# Truck-Pygame
A simple game written in Python as an example Pygame project

The project is needed to show the structure of the game on pygame. It implements AWSD control of the car. And of course weirdly moving bots, because they work on if's!

The number of bots is defined in the "amount_bot" variable of the main.py file, look for the rest of the values in settings.py and the Car folder
